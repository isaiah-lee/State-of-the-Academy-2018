        p Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham

            p Academics and coursework are a large part of the life of an Andover student, comprising both the school day and an average of 4.2 hours outside of the classroom. The average G.P.A. of respondents was 5.18, which is 0.03 points greater than the average G.P.A. from last year’s survey. In addition to coursework, many students also participate in additional extracurricular activities. 64% of respondents reported that they participated in extracurriculars partly to increase their chances of admission to a selective college, and 7% reported participating in extracurriculars solely for this reason. When looking at college admissions, Andover students are nearly split as to whether attending Andover would increase their chances of admission to a selective college, with 50.9% reporting that it would positively impact their chances and 42.3% reporting that it would negatively impact their chances. Finally, 45% of respondents support a change in the current academic schedule. Earlier this week, faculty voted to adopt a new schedule, Model A3, starting the Fall of 2019.

            p Addressing student wellness has been at the forefront of Andover’s mission to help students stay balanced. On average, Andover students sleep just under 6.7 hours per night. 78.7% of respondents consider themselves generally happy at Andover, while 63.0% of respondents think that Andover students are happy. The largest percentage of students, 38.5%, find their support system in their friends, with support systems including faculty and/or Sykes staff in addition to friends coming in a close second (33.40%). 166 students have been diagnosed with depression and 187 students have been diagnosed with anxiety, either before or after coming to Andover.

            p Like other high schools, Andover is susceptible to a pervasive drug and alcohol culture. Out of all Andover students, 21.6% have attended a school-sponsored event under the influence of drugs or alcohol, while 11.6% have used drugs or alcohol during the academic school day. Students of the Upper socioeconomic class have the highest percentages in consuming alcohol and tobacco products on and off campus; using “juuls” and hallucinogens or hard drugs on and off campus; using pharmaceutical or “study” drugs; and purchasing or owning a fake ID. These students also comprise the greatest percentage of daily consumers of drugs or alcohol on campus.

            h2 Discipline
            p When it is determined that an Andover student has committed a major offense, they are called upon a Disciplinary Committee (DC) that is usually comprised of their cluster dean, DC representative, cluster co-president, faculty DC representative, and house counselor or day student advisor. If a response to the student’s offense is deemed reputable, there are nine possibilities: Work Hours, Disciplinary Restriction, Bounding, Dean’s Reprimand, Censure, Warning, Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal. 78.04% of students believe that the school’s disciplinary system favors students of privileged backgrounds. Of all socio-economic classes, the highest percentage of students who have ever sat before a DC was lower class (18.18%), but the highest number of students who have ever sat before a DC was of the Upper class (24 students, 7.89% of Upper class respondents).
